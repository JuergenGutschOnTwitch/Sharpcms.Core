# Sharpcms.Core

The sharpcms is a pretty old C# CMS, which I own together with @thomas3577. We got the project ownership many years ago from a Danish developer who stopped maintaining it. I'd like to move the sharpcms to ASP.NET Core together with you and some other experts who will join the stream as guests.
